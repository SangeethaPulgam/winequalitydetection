# winequalitydetection
For this project ,i used kaggle's wine quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular wine is "good quality "or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a "quality" score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I coverted the output to a binary output where each wine is either "good quality"(a score of 8 or higher) or not(score below 8). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:
Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar 
Chlorides
Free sulphur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulfates
Alcohol

Objectives:
to experiment the good quality wine using different classification methods
steps involved in this project:

steps included in this project:
 1.Taking the data and Creating the dataframe
 2.Preprocessing-Filtering of Data
 3.Data Visualization
 4.Dividing into input and output(x-i/p,y-o/p)
 5.train and test the variables
 6.Noramization(scaling) the data(inputs only)
 7.Applying a suitable algorithm
 8.Fit the model(mapping the inputs with outputs)
 9.Predict the output
 10.Evaluation:Accuracy score
